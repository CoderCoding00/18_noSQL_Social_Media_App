# Social Network API NoSQL Project

## Purpose

Built an API for a social network web application. Users can share their thoughts, react to other users thoughts, and create a friend list. Using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

Created a walkthrough video to demonstrates the functionality, the link to the video is porvided at the end of this file. 

## Additional Features and Functionality

```md
* Uses a NoSQL database so the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

* When you enter the command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

* I used Insomnia to for testing. 

* Using the API Get routes for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

* Use the API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database

* API POST and DELETE to create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

### Links 

* A walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application and all of the acceptance criteria being met.
